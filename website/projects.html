            <h2>Internship-1</h2>
            <p>During my 3rd year, I completed an internship at Indian Servers, under the guidance of Sai Satish Sir, focusing on Machine Learning. Throughout the internship, which took place in May, I completed various tasks, and my final project is showcased below.</p>
            <p>

            <h2>Website Creation</h2>  
            <p>After completing the internship in July, I began creating a website using no-code tools, specifically WordPress, and hosted it on Profreehost, a platform that offers free hosting services. The website is designed to serve as a resource hub for my branch's study materials, syllabus copies, and lab manuals. Additionally, I integrated an attendance calculator on the website, which is a helpful tool for both my juniors and classmates.</p>
            <p>You can visit the website here:
                <br><a href="http://durgaprasad.unaux.com/?i=1" target="_blank"><h3>http://durgaprasad.unaux.com/?i=1</h3></a>
            <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Mobile App Creation</h2> 
            <p>From Website to Mobile App with Glide,After creating the website, I decided to take it a step further by developing a mobile app that mirrors the website's content. Using the same resources, I built a similar app using no-code tools, allowing users to access all the materials directly from their smartphones. The app, named "Kaboom," was developed on the Glide platform at no cost. One of the key features of the app is the mandatory login, which not only secures the content but also allows me to track and analyze how many new users are accessing the app. This has provided valuable insights into the app's reach and engagement.</p>
            <p>You can visit url of that app  here:
                <br><a href="https://kaboom-app-gfe1.glide.page/" target="_blank"><h3>https://kaboom-app-gfe1.glide.page/</h3></a><br></p>

            <h2>Community Survey Project</h2> 
            <p>After successfully creating my mobile app, I initiated a community survey project with a group of five friends. We chose to focus on raising awareness about the consumption of alcohol, its detrimental effects on health and family. Our campaign included educational sessions and a small awareness drive in the Seetharampuram area, West Godavari, where we engaged with the community to discuss these issues.</p>
            <br><p>During the course of our campaign, I conceived an idea for controlling alcohol consumption through the use of an IoT device. This device would verify a person's identity using their identity card information and then regulate their alcohol purchases based on a set weekly and monthly limit. The goal of this system is to reduce alcohol consumption by monitoring and limiting the amount each person can buy, with the hope that this could lead to healthier lifestyles and reduced alcohol-related problems in the community.</p>

            <h2>Internship-2</h2>
            <p>At the end of my 3rd year,I completed another internship at Indian Servers company, as well as with Aimer Society, both recognized by AICTE, this time focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Throughout this internship, I worked on various tasks that deepened my understanding of AI and its applications. Additionally, I took the opportunity to learn about cybersecurity, gaining valuable insights into protecting systems and data. This internship not only broadened my technical skills but also strengthened my ability to tackle complex challenges in AI and cybersecurity. My final project is showcased below.</p>

            <h2>YouTube Transcript Extractor</h2>
            <p>I deployed a project using the Streamlit platform. The project allows users to paste a YouTube URL and obtain a transcript of the video. This application simplifies the process of extracting and viewing the content of YouTube videos in a text format.</p><br>

                <p> The Image Resizer and Quality Adjuster is a web-based tool designed to help users modify the quality and file size of their images according to their specific needs.
